# Eclipse Color Theme

I basically ported my Eclipse syntax highlighting color scheme to VS Code.
I'm not affiliated with the Eclipse Foundation, and they have nothing to do with this extension.

I tested this extension with C++, Python, HTML, and XML. Some restrictions
in the syntax highlighting API prevent me from colorizing certain elements the way I want (e.g. C++ class members).
